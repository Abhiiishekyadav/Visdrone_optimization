## Drone Application using Attention-CNN Model:
This repository contains implementations of a drone-based application utilizing an Attention-CNN model with various optimization techniques. The project explores different strategies for improving model efficiency and robustness, including depth-wise separable convolutions, linear bottleneck blocks, quantization techniques, and adversarial attack analysis.

## Repository Structure:

1) Attention_visdrone/Implements the Attention-CNN model for drone applications using the VisDrone dataset. The architecture includes depth-wise separable convolutions and linear bottleneck blocks to enhance efficiency.

2) Attention_with_optimization/Applies various quantization techniques, including Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), to reduce model size and computational cost while maintaining performance.

3) Attention_with_attacks/Implements white-box adversarial attacks such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and Basic Iterative Method (BIM) to analyze the robustness of the model against adversarial perturbations.

4) cnn.xmodel is AMD-Xilinx DPU generated model file through vithis-ai.
